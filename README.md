# Android Kotlin Coroutines

## Motivation

This project aims to use the [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) of Kotlin.

The language used is [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

For the dependency injection, it uses [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin).

For the backend access, it uses [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/).

To manage the app flow, it uses the [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) component.

To test the application, it uses [MockK](https://github.com/mockk/mockk).

## Architecture

It uses three layers separated in three modules; `app`, `domain` and `data`. For the `ui` it uses the `MVP` model.
The `app` and `data` modules are Android Modules, and the `domain` module is a Java Module.
All is communicated through contracts.

- The `app` module contains the `Views` and the `Presenters`.
- The `domain` module contains the `Use Cases`.
- The `data` module contains the `Repositories` together with the `DataSources` and the `APIs`.

## What it does?

It uses [JSONPlaceHolder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a backend to retrieve a list of users.
When a user in the list is clicked, it goes to a detail view of that user.

## Calls used

```kolin
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{{user_id}}
```

## Tests

Tests can be found for the `app` and `data` modules.
